Basic P2P Grid Overlay
Sends strings by navigating through a grid randomly - basically, a really really simple version of the TOR project

Grid Coordinates are set up as follows
(0, 0) (1, 0) (2, 0)
(0, 1) (1, 1) (2, 1) 
etc 

Usage: java PGOPeer <coord> <coord> to set up the grid 
FileTransfer.java takes in the string to be sent (with more time, this would've taken a filename and sent the actual file)
